The black sky studded with stars, and nearby town lit with lamps (on which they gaze) indicate a night scene. Radha and Krishna are shown again in the same architectural setting in a room playing a board game that looks like chess. Radha is seen making a move while lady musicians entertain the couple. Gambling at Diwali is a ritual in order to propitiate Lakshmi, Goddess of Wealth. Another couple are seen in miniature in the foreground playing chaupar, a popular game. In the foreground ladies bathe in a lotus filled pool before a shrine housing a linga and yoni, emblem of Śiva and Parvati. The lush foliage of the trees and exuberant flowering creepers separate the pavilion from the gaily lit town seen in the far distance.",

    description: "Painting from an album containing thirteen Rajasthani and provincial Mughal miniature paintings.\nThe setting of this unusual ceremony is in a courtyard in a zenana or the women's quarters of a palace or large mansion. The ceremony appears to be taking place at night under the light of a new moon. Oil lamps are lit in the niches providing some light. A young lady of noble birth is undergoing initiation rites into a religious cult. Her elderly lady attendant sits nearby watching the proceedings. The elderly darkskinned kanphat yogi seated in front of the lady being initiated may be her guru who appears to be conducting the ceremony. He seems to be communicating with his young protege, perhaps explaining initiaton rites and her role henceforth as a kanphat yogini. She appears to be listening intently and with total focus and devotion to her guru, as he explains. Kanphat yogis and yoginis are part of the Saivite tradition, hence the ash or vibhuti marks on the forehead of the elderly ascetic. The dark skinned ascetic holds a morchal or peacock feathered whisk in his left hand. His right hand holds a back scratcher, perhaps an ascetic's crutch, which he hands to the heroine.\n\nThree other priests appear to be assisting in the ceremony. One holds the hair of the lady initiate, which he may be tying into a jata or topknot that yoginis wore. The other priest is walking purposefully toward the lady initiate holding aloft a sacred rope which the yogini will wear after discarding her jewellery and rich clothing for simpler garb. The lady initiate has removed her shoes which the third priest holds in his hands. The ceremony takes place around a sacred fire from which smoke emanates. Hot coals are being brought in to add to the fire by a young maid in the right background. Ladies of the zenana watch interestedly from balconies and windows overlooking the open courtyard. They talk to each other and getsure at the unusual proceedings taking place below. White walled architecture provides a stark but perfect backdrop for the figures intent on the proceedings.",

The main theme is that of nayakas' and nayikas' (lovers) love in union and in separation and their relationship with the months of the year.\nUnder a starry, moonlit sky Radha and Krishna as nayika (heroine) and nayaka (hero) are shown twice here. In the foreground they play holi with women on a terrace, squirting coloured liquid at each other through golden syringes. Seated on a terraced pavilion they play with a child being presented to them by a woman. Below the pavilion revellers make merry while a bonfire burns in the distance.The white architecture with zigzagging yellow, orange and maroon decorations painted as borders on walls, serves as a convenient backdrop for the festivities. A peacock and peahen perched on the rooftop are awakened by the noise of the revellers below. Lit oil lamps and flares indicate the late hour as do the stars and moon in the night sky. Fountains are painted around the terrace in the foreground. The blue skinned Krishna, avatara of Visnu , wears a golden crown with three lotuses on top of an orange turban, gold slippers and a transparent white jama over gaily striped pyjamas. Radha and the women wear brightly coloured skirts, blouses and transparent veils outlined in gold paint. Gold is also used on the orange awning, chair, the bonfire, lamps and architectural details giving the painting an opulent look.",

The main theme is that of nayakas' and nayikas' (lovers) love in union and in separation and their relationship with the months of the year.\nIn this cold month Krishna and Radha are shown seated on a terrace covered with warm shawls, a tray of betelnut near them. The blue skinned Krishna, crowned with a single lotus blossom on a gold crown over an orange turban is resplendent in a gold patterned tunic over gold and orange striped pyjamas leaning on an aquamarine cushion. The starkness of the white architectural setting is broken by green tiled flooring, stairs leading up to a terrace where the lovers sit, green awning, and by richly coloured carpets in blues, yellows and oranges. A man is being massaged by oil in a room off the courtyard, to the right of the picture plane. Another bare chested man awaits his turn in another small room off the courtyard, while two men draped in shawls warm themselves in front of an open fire in the courtyard. The sun is setting in the distant horizon over a yellow landscape indicating the dry winter months. However, the Bundi penchant for greenery and foliage is evident; the artist could not help but include some trees beyond the courtyard walls.",

By his side is Alcmena (flesh painted white), pointing to the scene below with right hand, and placing left round Zeus' neck; she has long hair with curls in front of ears, necklace, bracelets, long sleeved chiton, and embroidered himation with border of spirals. Behind them is an Eros with long curls, fillet, and sandals, kneeling on left knee, holding up a taenia in both hands; in the field below him, a ball and a phiale.\n(b) Dionysiac scene: In the centre is a Maenad seated to right, looking to left, with hair in a top-knot, tied by a taenia at the back, with curls in front, earrings, necklace, bracelets, and long chiton with wave-border and girdle; she holds up in left hand a white tympanon with rings and crosses round the edge, and by her side is another.

The other is dancing, and has a wreath, panther's skin knotted round neck, thyrsos in right hand and rhyton in left; below him is a diota, ornamented with tongue and wave-patterns, fallen on its side. On the extreme left is Ariadne (?), seated on a higher level to right, looking back at Dionysos on the obverse; she has hair as the Maenad, necklace, bracelets, embroidered chiton reaching to knees, with borders of wave and other patterns, and endromides with tops turned over, and her flesh is painted white; she holds a large white fan in left hand and thyrsos in right; below her, a phiale, and in the centre of the scene a ball marked with a cross.

    description: "Ink and wash drawing on European paper of the family of Śiva carried in procession. The first two palanquins show the images of Gaṇeśa and Subrahmanya and their consorts. Led by a man carrying the chhattra (parasol), the third and last palanquin carries Śiva and Pārvatī seated against a bolster, on a throne surrounded by a prabhavali (ornamental arch). Śiva carries in his upper right hand the mriga (gazelle) and in his upper left the damaru (hourglass shaped drum), while his lower right hand is in abhaya and the left in varada mudra. The throne rests at the front on the shoulders of the kneeling Nandíkesvara, supported at the rear by an elegantly shaped slender wooden column. The huge four-armed Nandíkesvara, armed with sword and buckler, dwarfs the divine couple. Flanking the palanquin are torchbearers carrying three- and six-armed torches and assistants with floral wreaths, trays of fruit, oil flasks and ritual objects.",

Obser. on the Marriage of Cana by Paolo.

The table-cloth, the end on the other side, with the lady, makes a large mass of light. Almost all the other figures seem to be in Mezzotint; here and there a little brightness to hinder it from looking heavy. All the banisters are mezzotint; between some of them, on the right side is seen the light building to hinder the line of shadow so as to make the picture look half shadow & half light. The sky Blue, with white clouds. The lower in the middle white as the clouds; and so all the distant architecture, which grows darker and darker as it approaches the fore figures; between the dark Architecture in the foreground and the light behind, are placed figures to join them as it were together.\nf. 72.

Observations on the Marriage at Cana in Galilee by Tintoret.\nOne sees by this Picture the great use Tintoretto made of his Pasteboard houses and wax figures for the distribution of his Masses. This Picture has the most natural light and shadow that can be imagined. All the light conies from the several Windows over the table. The woman, who stands and leans forward to have a Glass of liquor, is of great service : she covers part of the Table cloth, so that there is not too much white in the Picture, and by means of her strong shadows she throws back the table, and makes the perspective more agreeable; but, that her figure might not appear like a dark inlaid figure on a light Ground, her face is light her hair masses with the ground, and the light of her handkerchief is whiter than the table cloth. The shadows blue Ultr., strong. Shadows of the Table-cloth Blueish, all the other colours of the draperies are like those of a washed drawing. One sees indeed a little lake drapery here and there, and one strong yellow, he that receives the liquor.\nf. 71. Ob. [In this and other cases, the precise order of the pages has been departed from, in order that the notes may be read continuously.] This Picture has nothing of mistiness: the floor is light, an oily Grey;\nthe Table cloth in comparison is blue; and the figures are releiv'd from it\n\tstrongly by being dark, but of no colour scarce.    The figure of the woman who\npoures out liquor, tho' her shadows are very dark, her lights, particularly on the knee, is lighter than the Ground. All the women at the Table make one mass of light.\nThe Last Supper of him [Tintoret] in S. Georgio, is managed something in the same, only the Apostles are all on one side. The light is behind them, and throws their shadows on the table.\nf. 71. Rev.   Salute.\nThe Descent of the Holy Ghost by Titian.—In the Suffitto of the high Altar, three fine Pictures of Salviati.

A print by Febre; another in wood by Titian himself, a little different from this picture.\nOn the right hand of this Chapel is the Last Supper, by Benedetto Caliari, according to Boschini.

    description: "Sketch book of 119 drawings on 117 leaves; mainly figure studies including life studies, mythological and allegorical figures including Andromeda, cupid, Leda and the Swan, studies based on paintings by Old Masters and contemporary artists, and many studies for portraits.\nThe sketchbook itself is bound in brown leather, with the word ‘Letters’ tooled onto the spine and with decorative gold tooling embellishing the front, back and spine.\nGraphite, unless otherwise stated\n191- A woman in profile leaning over to examine her reflection.\n192 - A little boy dressed in armour and holding a spear; he leans on the knee of a crouching woman who places a helmet on his head, while gazing heavenwards. \n193 - A man and a woman standing side by side with their arms across one another’s shoulders in front of a giant urn on a plinth, the man gesturing with his left hand, presumably to some inscription below the urn.  \n194 - A man and a woman standing side by side holding hands; the man has one arm around her waist, and her hand is pressed to her chest. \n195 - A young female angel in a flying or floating posture amongst clouds, playing a small harp which she leans on her shoulder.  \n196 – A woman in profile crouches before a baby in a walker with its arms outstretched; she is encouraging him to walk forwards, beckoning with her hands and smiling.  \n197 – A depiction of the Goddess Diana; she appears to be striding forwards and reaching for an arrow from the quiver on her back, her left arm stretched out in front of her holding a bow.\n198 – A daydreaming woman dressed in a classically inspired empire line dress leaning against the plinth of an urn and resting her face in one hand. \n199 – A depiction of Christ as a child, facing the viewer and holding his hands together in prayer; above is a dove with spread wings, close behind is a lion, and in front is a lamb.  \n200 – Self portrait of the artist with pallet and brushes, dressed in renaissance style costume with a long voluminous cloak draped across his knee, twisting around to paint on an easel.\n201 – A nude woman craning her neck around to look over her shoulder stepping into water with one knee resting on a bank, and one hand holding onto a branch above her head for support.  \n202 – A Woman sitting on the ground gesturing outward with her arm as a little boy in a tunic begins to clamber energetically onto her.\n203 – A woman washing the foot of a child sat on her knee; the child peers coyly out while trying to hide his head under his mother’s shawl.  \n204 – A seated woman leaning on a column, turning to look at a child leaning over her shoulder; a baby beside her plays a trumpet and another child peeps over her skirts.\n205 - A seated woman leaning on her knees, resting her face in one hand which also clasps a shawl which drapes over her head and shoulders and partly hides her face.\n206 – A woman in classical costume, holding her shawl to her face, and peering out coyly from behind her hand. The subject relates to the previous drawing (205). \n207 – A kneeling woman holding a small child on her shoulders, while another child stands behind her, leaning against her back, and another leans on her knee reaching up to suckle at her exposed breast; possibly intended as an allegorical personification of Charity.\n208 – A female figure in transparent classical drapery, possible representing Justice, holding up something resembling the separated parts of a set of hanging scales in each hand, a putto next to her stretching his arms towards the sky.\n209 – A woman cradling an infant in her arms looking round at another boy, who stretches up to hand something to the infant - probably a representation of Mary and Jesus and the infant St John.\n210 – A woman in transparent classical dress holding a baby in one arm, while reaching down to take something from a little putto who holds a large bowl piled with fruit.  \n211 – A seated woman with a shawl draped over her head, with her hands clasped together in her lap, turning her head to look towards the viewer.  \n212 – A representation of infant Christ reclining, leaning his head on one hand and gazing heavenwards contemplatively, with a loosely sketched cross shape above his head.\n213 – A woman in classical dress carrying a large ornate vase on her shoulder, with an architectural structure, perhaps representing a well.  \n214 – Probably a representation of the goddess Diana in loose transparent classical dress, holding out a bow and reaching over her shoulder to draw an arrow from her quiver \n215 – A woman holding a large parasol walking and holding hands with a little girl; both turn their heads to look towards the viewer and both shade one side of their faces with shawls.\n216 – A woman in a classical style dress stepping forwards through clouds and holding a large dark shawl above her head with both hands; possibly a representation of the Greek goddess Nyx.\n217 – A seated woman facing the viewer and cradling a suckling child in her arms.\n218 – A seated woman dressed in classical style costume, breast feeding a sleeping baby.\n219 – A naked kneeling woman with a baby on her shoulders, holding both his arms up above his head.\n220 – A representation of the temptation of St Anthony; an old man with a smiling devil over his shoulder sits on the floor, pouring over a book while a semi-naked woman in front of him removes her drapery.  \n221 – A naked woman with her head bent appears to be dangling her hair into a large vase with the help of a small child or putti.\n222 – A naked woman wearing a necklace and holding a shawl which billows out behind her like a sale.  \n223 – A seated woman, leaning down to kiss the mouth of a boy that leans on her knee.\n224 – A woman, probably representing Venus, in classical dress, facing the viewer holding a billowing shawl over her head with one hand, and cradling a dove next to her face with the other.\n225 – A Naked woman, lounging on a couch, propped up by cushions and holding a shawl above her head with one hand; she smiles out at the viewer.

She holds up a triangle in her left hand and strikes it with her right.   \n227 – Two seated naked women, each with an arm around the other, kissing.  The woman on the left holds a shawl above both their heads as if to shield them from view. \n228 – A woman on the right plays the piano, facing away from the viewer, with another woman on the left facing the viewer and leaning on the first woman’s shoulder.  \n229 – A seated man twists his upper body around to paint on a canvas placed on an easel to his left.

    type: "icon",
    name: "Icon with the Noli me tangere (Object)",
    description: "The icon is painted with egg tempera, oil and gold leaf on cypress wood, primed with cloth (linen?) and gesso.  It is a single wooden panel, strengthened with a pair of horizontal battens on the reverse. It is framed by a narrow orange red painted band, now largely destroyed around the lower left corner. \nThe main subject is the Noli me tangere, but other scenes from the first Easter morning are included. In a rocky landscape on the top left are the three crosses of Calvary, a building of an Italian character at the top centre, at the upper right are the myrrh-bearers with the angel at the sepulchre (Mark 16:1), at the left centre is Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre with two angels (John 20:13), with, below, the greeting of the myrrh-bearers; at the lower centre and right is the Noli me tangere: Christ stands at the right, haloed and elaborately dressed, holding a scroll in his left hand, and extending his right to the kneeling figure of Mary Magdalene. The wounds of the crucifixion are clearly visible on his body. On the ground between them is a golden urn containing the myrrh for Christ’s body. \nThe icon represents the appearance of Christ to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection as described in the Gospel of John (20:15-17). The scene is known as Noli me tangere (“Let no one touch me”), the Latin translation of his words. The other episodes from the Gospels complement the main event, and they are identified by Greek majuscule inscriptions in red and black. \nThe resurrected Christ is slightly drawn back and addresses Mary Magdalene, who is kneeling in front of him trying to touch him.  Between them are inscriptions reproducing the (abbreviated) Gospel dialogue: ΓΥΝΑΙ ΤΙ ΚΛΑΙΕΙC; ΤΙΝΑ ZHTEIC; ('Woman why do you weep? Whom do you seek?'), to which she responds, taking him for the gardener: ΚΥΡΙΕ ΕΙ CΥ ΕΒΑCΤΑCΑC ΑΥΤΟΝ ΚΑΓΩ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΑΡΩ ('Sir, if you have taken him from here, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away'). Christ then called her name, ΜΑΡΙΑ ('Mary'), and she recognised him and exclaimed ΡΑΒΟΥΝΙ ('Rabboni', which is master in Hebrew), raising her arms. To this he replied: ΜΗ ΜΟΥ ΑΠΤΟΥ ('Touch me not').\nThe various scenes can be further identified as follows. To the left of the main episode is the ‘Chairete’ scene with Christ blessing the two Marys; his mother, crossing her arms in front of her chest, and the Magdalene, performing a full prostration. The scene is inscribed as: ΧΑΙΡΕ ΤΩΝ ΜΥΡΟΦΟΡΩΝ ('Greeting of the myrrh-bearers'). \nAbove the ‘Chairete’ is the episode of the empty tomb which predates the appearance of Christ to Mary Magdalene. As she approaches the burial site, holding the myrrh urn, she finds to her astonishment two angels sitting on the open sarcophagus (John, 20:11-13). One is pointing at the shroud and cloth used for swathing Christ’s head, while the other is raising his right hand towards heaven. Two inscriptions accompany the scene, reproducing verbatim parts of the Gospel. One is to the left of Mary’s head: ΜΑΡΙΑ ΔΕ ΕΙCΤΗΚΕΙ ΠΡΟC ΤΩ ΜΝΗΜΕΙΩ ΚΛΑΙΟΥCΑ ΕΞΩ ('But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping'). The other is between the angels: ΚΑΙ ΛΕΓΟΥCΙΝ ΑΥΤΗ ΕΚΕΙΝΟΙ ΓΥΝΑΙ ΤΙ ΚΛΑΙΕΙC ('And they say unto her, Woman, why do you weep?'). \nA variation of the empty tomb episode, drawing from the Gospel of Mark (16:1-8), unfolds to the right of the upper part of the icon. In this case three myrrh-bearers, led by Mary Magdalene, are confronted by a single angel pointing at the tomb. Three inscriptions render passages from the Gospel. The first, a later addition, is on the gold background, above the three women: ΜΑΡΙΑ Η ΜΑΓΔΑΛΗΝΗ ΚΑΙ ΜΑΡΙΑ ΤΟΥ ΙΑΚΩΒΟΥ ΚΑΙ CΑΛΩΜΗ ΗΓΟΡΑCΑΝ ΑΡΩΜΑΤΑ ΙΝΑ ΕΛΘΟΥCΑΙ ΑΛΕΙΨΩCΙΝ AYTOΝ ('Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him'). The second inscription is on the rock above the angel’s wing: ΜΗΝ ΕΚΘΑΜΒΕΙCΘΕ ΙΗCΟΥΝ ΖΗΤΕΙΤΕ ΤOΝ ΝΑΖΑΡΗΝΟΝ ΤΟΝ ΕCΤΑΥΡΩΜΕΝΟΝ ('Be not afraid: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified'), while the third is over the sarcophagus: ΙΔΕ Ο ΤΟΠΟC ΟΠΟΥ ΕΘΗΚΑΝ ΑΥΤΟΝ ('Behold the place where they laid him'). Christ’s empty sarcophagus before a rocky pit is represented for the third time between the two groups of buildings denoting Jerusalem.",

The margins of the painting are here inked and used to suggest the outer wall of a temple complex at whose centre is a Gaṇeśa shrine. Gaṇeśa sits in lalitasana, carrying in his upper right hand the ankusha (elephant goad), in his upper left hand, the pasha (noose), the broken tusk in his lower right and the laddu (sweetmeats) in his lower left hand. In front of the image are trays filled with offerings. Oil lamps hang from the ceiling and two standing oil lamps flank the image. In the courtyard, facing the enshrined image, is the image of the crouching bandicoot. The architectural details of the building are all carefully rendered. Two priests, one carrying a bell and an arati lamp, the other a tray with flowers, perform a puja before the image of the deity.  A group of devotees, bearing offerings, follow the puja from outside the shrine. Two dancing girls accompanied by two groups of musicians, who play cymbals, bagpipes, nagasvaram and mridangas, complete the picture. .",

    description: "Oil painting on canvas. The painting depicts the return of the goddess Devi Agamani (Uma or Durga), who is shown jewelled and crowned in the distinctive Bengali form, with tall pointed headgear.  She is seated on a lotus saddle-cover and rides on her lion 'vahana', or animal mount. She is greeted by her father Himavant, who is dressed in royal attire and advances towards her. The goddess carries in her lap her child, elephant-headed Ganesha, whose diminutive arms are held out towards his grandfather in a mirror gesture of greeting. To the left and behind Himavant, but full of emotion at the moment of welcome, is Uma's mother. She takes up the traditionally correct position indicating that - at least in the public domain - she is secondary in importance to her husband. Hovering in the doorway yet further behind are other members of the household, flanked by plantains, auspicious garlanded pots and fluttering mango leaves over the lintel, all indications of good fortune and welcome. One of these attendants carries a yak-tail fly-whisk, while another appears to blow on a conch, also a sign of welcome. The other figure in the foreground is dark-skinned Nandikeshvara, Śiva's bull mount in human form. He accompanies his lord's wife on her journey from Mount Kailash to her parents'  home. Finally, at a quite different scale, in the upper right-hand corner of the painting, three of the other subsidiary figures of the Durga Puja are depicted. Flying on their bird mounts are the deities - from left to right, Lakshmi on her owl, Sarasvati on her swan and Karttikeya on his peacock - all descending to earth to take part in the Puja of the goddess, who in Bengal is considered to be their mother. These three deities, along with Ganesha, are traditionally shown as accompanying Durga in the Puja tableaux, which are the most obvious public manifestation of this festival. Their Georgian-style mansion is seen behind, in the door-way of which stand other women of the household.",

Garlands of beads hang from his neck. In his right hand he carries a banner with the effigy of Ramanuja and in his left a ribbed begging bowl. Near him is his wife, in a nine-yard sari and a blouse, with a brass bowl in her right hand. The second couple is identified by a label ‘Pandarams’. The Pandarams are priests of the lower Hindu castes of South India. The man, with a bushy moustache, wears a white dhoti with a thin red border, an angavastra  (shawl) draped around his shoulders and a conical red and green cap. Tripundras  (three horizontal lines) are drawn on his forehead, throat, chest and arms. Rudraksha beads hang from his neck, and on his right wrist is a bracelet of similar beads. In the crook of his left arm he carries a spear and in his left hand a gong and wooden mallet. From his right shoulder hangs a begging bowl (?). His wife wears a nine-yard sari covering her breasts with tripundras on her forehead and arms. In her hand she carries a cloth bag. The third couple is identified by the label as ‘Juggler’.  The man, with a moustache and a Tengalai namam on his forehead, wears short trousers, a flowing jacket and a Maratha-style turban decorated with peacock feathers and other ornaments. Hanging from his neck is a large round plaque representing Vira Anjaneya as well as numerous strings of rudraksha beads. In his right hand he carries an ornate conch shell, which he blows, and in his left he holds a metal gong with a wooden mallet. Hung on his right shoulder is a begging bowl on which is drawn a Tengalai namam. His wife wears a simple sari and blouse, and a shoulder bag is slung over her right shoulder. In her right hand is a morchhal, a peacock-feather fan. Between them is an oil lamp on a tall stand.",

Viṣṇu stands in samabhanga, shown as Cheluvanarayanasvami, chief deity of the Melukote Tirunarayana temple in Karnataka.

Between the feet of the god sits Bibi Nachchiyar, resting her shoulders against a large bolster. She carries lotuses in her upper hands, her lower right hand is in abhaya and her lower left in varada mudra. Cheluvanarayanasvami wears a dhoti with side sashes, angavastra (shawl), jewellery and a floral garland draped over his shoulders.  The image wears a yajnopavita (sacred thread) across its chest as well as carefully drawn namams (emblems) on its forehead, throat and arms. The images are surrounded by a metal frame, with a lobed arch culminating in a kirttikmukha (lion mask) mask. The arch issues from the mouth of two makaras (mythical creatures) placed on a pillar on either side of the images. Above the makaras to the right and left of the images are respectively the chakra and the shankha. Two priests, dressed in dhotis and with the angavastra tied around their hips and knotted in front, flank the images. They have namams on their foreheads, throats and arms. One carries an oil lamp. The other offers sprigs of tulsi to the image.",

    description: "The coffee-room of a provincial inn with a large bow-window (right) through which the adjacent bow-window, the street, and the opposite houses are seen. The room is filled with objects and placards, realistically drawn. A fat man drawing on his boots registers pain and alarm, wildly flourishing a leg, while two fashionably dressed young men stand by, affecting concern. Wasps fly from the boots. Verses (20 ll.) below the design describe the trick they have played on 'A travelling Prig' (coxcomb) by putting wasps inside his boots. Two breakfast-tables stand in the window on which are tea- and coffee-things with bread, grapes, boiled eggs, a honey-pot shaped like a bee-hive. On the wall over the door are placards: (1) 'The World', two hemispheres, with a chess-board hung against it. (2) 'Installation A well aired two bedded Room to let with every accomodation for four Single Gentlemen'. (3) 'By order of the Magistrates no Hawkers are permitted'. A glass-fronted corner-cupboard is inscribed 'Rich Cordials and Compounds', while its key is labelled 'Club Property'; it contains a bowl inscribed 'Rum Punch' [with the figure of Punch] into which jars of 'Aqua Fortis', 'Castor Oil', and 'Pus Var-Vac' empty their contents. A rat sniffs at a trap. On the upper shelf an open 'Strong Box' contains playing-cards; beside it are a 'Tooth Pick' in a glass and dice-boxes. Above the chimney-piece a placard headed 'Club Law' is torn to reveal a print of one man clubbing another. Behind the frame are stuck three prints of birds (with punning names): 'A Rook', 'A Pigeon', and a 'Blackleg'. A bag of 'Draughtsmen Rooks, Pawns &c' hangs from a nail. Another framed notice: 'Genuine Beer From Malt & Hops Only'; into this are stuck papers docketed: 'Drs Bill, Paid for Quassia, Wormwood', and 'Tobacco' [indicating adulterated beer, see No. 10795, &c.]. China figures symmetrically arranged on the chimney-piece are (left to right) a classical group of Mercury with a nymph and child (cf. No. 7592), a bear stealing honey, a comic parson, a walrus, Bacchus astride a cask. On the wall is a large framed placard: 'Laws of the Musical Society held in these rooms.—1st No Person to be admitted that stops more than half a note out of tune.  II To prevent inovation (the ruin of music) No piece to be played out of the black letter and lozenge character. III Any Gentleman that greases anothers bow—Lifts it off the strings—Gives him the wrong piece of music to play or wrong pitch in tuning, to pay forfeit IV The forfeits to go towards buying an Iron shoe and long Cane or the Leader. [Signed] B Doss Secretary'. Below this is a wall-map of Spain: 'Seat of [the War in S]pain'.\nIn the foreground is a pile of baggage (left): a bale inscribed 'This side uppermost' is upside down; another, 'To be Kept Dry', receives the contents of a broken flask. A dog approaches a joint of beef on a low table, a magpie stands on a platter of peas inscribed 'Pease upon a Trencher'. Other objects in the room have inscriptions: inside the traveller's hat is a ticket: 'not exceeding five shillings and a stamp (cf. No. 9004); on the coal-scuttle is the sign of the Sun Fire-Office with the number '1234'.\nOutside the door (left) and in shadow a fat man stands in a bar inscribed 'Wines Neat as Imported', concocting 'Port' from bottles of 'Cider' and 'Sloe Juice'. A maidservant, broom in hand, stoops to fill from a bucket a bowl inscribed 'Sillabub Under the Cow'. A man uncorks a bottle of 'Spruce Beer' whose contents explode violently. In a coffee-mill inscribed 'Mocha Coffee' is a packet of 'Roasted Beans'.\nOutside the window are seen (left) boards: 'Dealer in Foreign Spirits' with a pendent brunch of grapes, and 'Neat Post Chaise and Able Horses'. Below is a battered chaise with a post-boy lashing two wretched hacks which a man thrashes with a broom. Above is a large lantern inscribed 'Just Arrived From Abroad the Phantasmagoria by the Sieur Philipstal' [see No. 9962]. Below the adjacent bow-window is 'Good Entertainment for Man and Beast': in the window a man embraces a woman. Above it are masonic symbols. In the narrow old-fashioned street is a man carrying a dead pig. Each of three stories of the two opposite houses has a large inscription above the window. On the left, 2nd floor: 'Fun decently Performed'; 1st floor: 'Dancing Taught', with a man teaching a bear to dance seen through the window; ground-floor: 'Horseflesh Pork Man'; above the door 'Nl Dance' [? a gibe at Sir Nathaniel Dance, 1748-1827] and 'Music Provided'. Next door (right), 2nd floor: 'Painting in General' [a woman paints her face at a mirror]. 1st floor: 'A Genteel School for Young ladies' [a virago plies a birch-rod on hapless infants, one wearing a fool's cap]. Ground-floor: 'Phlebotomy Practised' and 'Trepan Surgeon' [a man amputates a leg]. Above the door: 'Mangling Done Here.'\n16 April 1810\nHand-coloured etching and aquatint",

One shows a scholar-official wearing a black gauze hat with 'wings', a loose round-necked robe, rank badge and boots. He is walking in a landscape with two servants, one carrying a large pile of books on his shoulder, the other standing behind his master holding a large round fan decorated with plum blossom. The scene is bordered above and below with a chrysanthemum scroll, the handle with a daylily. The other tankard is decorated with a landscape with two figures dressed in loose V-necked robes tied at the front with a sash. One is holding a spray of 'lingzhi' fungus while the other carries a basket of flowers, possibly representing Lan Caihe, one of the Eight Daoist Immortals. It is framed by a border of flower scrolls above and below. Each tankard has a flat unglazed base.",

Made in the style of 'pardeh' (Persian for 'curtain') or 'coffeehouse' paintings depicting scenes from the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, at the Battle of Karbala (in modern central Iraq) in 680 AD. While most extant paintings date to the late 19th-early 20th century and were executed with oil paints on canvas, this modern work departs from tradition through the use of the linocut technique and Zenderoudi's unconventional interpretation of commonly depicted scenes.\nAn inscription in Persian along the border of the work repeats, 'Who is this Hossein the world is crazy about?' until it reaches the bottom of the frame, where the inscription ends with, 'Who is this flame (candle), for which all souls are moths?' The artist's signature is written from right to left in an upward direction in a vertical panel at lower left, just within the inscriptional frame.",
