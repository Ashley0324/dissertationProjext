# Flutter | AR museum application 

###The museum of museums: an augmented reality application for digital museum heritageÂ 

Culture and art are important parts of citizens' life. As AR technology continues to mature, more and more museums and exhibitions are beginning to integrate it with their collections. This creative application can enhance the visitor experience and is also strongly supported by the government.

However, the existing cases that combine AR with digital heritage are usually combined with museum field scenes. This does not solve some of the barriers for visitors, such as long traffic times, unreasonable timing, and distance between different museums.

Therefore, this project developed a Flutter-based iOS AR museum application to help users visit collections from multiple museums without leaving home. In addition, the application of AR technology will also enhance the fun and interactivity of the visiting process.
